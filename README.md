# Improper Error Handling in Express.js Async Operations

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling within asynchronous operations.  The `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js server with an asynchronous function (`someAsyncOperation`) that may throw an error.  However, the error handling is incomplete; it logs the error to the console but doesn't send an appropriate error response to the client.

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling, ensuring that clients receive informative error responses in case of failures.

## How to Reproduce the Bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing `bug.js`.
3. Run `node bug.js`.
4. Access the server in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). Refresh the page several times. You might see the server intermittently fail silently or not respond, depending on the random nature of the simulated error.

## Solution
The solution involves properly handling the `catch` block within the asynchronous operation. Instead of simply logging the error, it sends an appropriate HTTP error response to the client, providing a clear indication of the failure. This improves user experience and facilitates debugging.
